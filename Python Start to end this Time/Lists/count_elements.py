Exercise 128: Count the Elements

Pythonâ€™s standard library includes a method named count that determines how
many times a specific value occurs in a list. In this exercise, you will create a new
function named countRange. It will determine and return the number of elements
within a list that are ```greater``` than or equal to some ```minimum``` value and ```less```
than some ```maximum``` value. Your function will take three parameters: the list, the minimum
value and the maximum value. It will return an integer result greater than or equal to
0. Include a main program that demonstrates your function for several different lists,
minimum values and maximum values. Ensure that your program works correctly
for both lists of integers and lists of floating-point numbers.
