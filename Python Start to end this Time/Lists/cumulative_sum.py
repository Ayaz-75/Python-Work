Exercise 10-2.

Write a function called cumsum that takes a list of numbers and returns the cumulative
sum; that is, a new list where the ith element is the sum of the first i+1 elements from
the original list.

For example:
t = [1, 2, 3]
    cumsum(t)
    [1, 3, 6]

'''
t = [1, 2, 3]
new_list = []


def cumsum(lis):
    for nums in lis:
        pass

    return new_list


print(cumsum(t))
